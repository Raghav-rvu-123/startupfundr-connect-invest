# StartupFundr Backend Documentation

## Overview
The backend of StartupFundr is built using Java Spring Boot with MongoDB as the database. It provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the database, handling user authentication, startup management, investment processing, and other core functionalities.

## Current Implementation

### Core Architecture
- **Spring Boot Framework** - For building the REST API
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for data storage
- **RESTful API Design** - For standardized client-server communication

### API Endpoints

#### Startups
- `GET /api/startups` - Get all startups
- `GET /api/startups/featured` - Get featured startups
- `GET /api/startups/{id}` - Get startup by ID
- `GET /api/startups/industry/{industry}` - Get startups by industry
- `POST /api/startups` - Create a new startup
- `PUT /api/startups/{id}` - Update a startup
- `DELETE /api/startups/{id}` - Delete a startup

#### Success Stories
- `GET /api/success-stories` - Get all success stories
- `GET /api/success-stories/recent` - Get recent success stories
- `GET /api/success-stories/featured` - Get featured success stories
- `GET /api/success-stories/{id}` - Get success story by ID
- `POST /api/success-stories` - Create a new success story
- `PUT /api/success-stories/{id}` - Update a success story
- `DELETE /api/success-stories/{id}` - Delete a success story

#### Users
- Basic user repository setup with MongoDB integration
- User model definition with essential fields

### Models
- **Startup** - Contains startup details, funding goals, etc.
- **SuccessStory** - Contains success story details and metrics
- **User** - Contains user account information
- **Investment** - Contains investment transaction details

### Services
- **StartupService** - Business logic for startup operations
- **SuccessStoryService** - Business logic for success story operations

### Repositories
- **StartupRepository** - Data access for startups
- **SuccessStoryRepository** - Data access for success stories
- **UserRepository** - Data access for users
- **InvestmentRepository** - Data access for investments

### Configuration
- **CORS Configuration** - Set up to allow requests from frontend
- **Spring Boot Configuration** - Basic setup for MongoDB connection

## Remaining Tasks

### API Endpoints to Implement
- **Authentication Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
  - `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` - Refresh authentication token
  - `GET /api/auth/verify-email` - Email verification

- **User Management Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/users/{id}` - Get user profile
  - `PUT /api/users/{id}` - Update user profile
  - `DELETE /api/users/{id}` - Delete user account
  - `PUT /api/users/{id}/change-password` - Change user password

- **Investment Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/investments` - Get user investments
  - `POST /api/investments` - Create new investment

- **Transaction Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/transactions/deposit` - Add funds to wallet
  - `POST /api/transactions/withdraw` - Withdraw funds from wallet
  - `GET /api/transactions/history` - Get transaction history

- **Notification Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/notifications` - Get user notifications
  - `PUT /api/notifications/{id}/read` - Mark notification as read
  - `DELETE /api/notifications/{id}` - Delete notification

- **Admin Endpoints**:
