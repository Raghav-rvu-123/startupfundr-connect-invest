## Overview
The frontend of StartupFundr is built using React with TypeScript, leveraging Vite as the build tool. The UI is constructed using Tailwind CSS for styling and shadcn/ui for component architecture. The application follows a modern, responsive design pattern suitable for various device sizes.
